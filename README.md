# AlgoTrading
The objective of the current assignment is to devise an optimal trading strategy for a given stock. To
devise this trading strategy, I have implemented the technique of reinforcement learning using Q
learner. The learner is trained by fetching it financial data of a stock, from which it learns to trade or not
to trade stock each minute. After this an out of sample data set is given to learner, so that it can predict
a portfolio which is then evaluated for performance.
